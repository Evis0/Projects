This Java program is a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier designed for classifying movies based on their attributes. 
It processes movie data by converting attributes such as genre, runtime, year, and IMDb score into numerical feature vectors. 
The program measures the similarity between these feature vectors using cosine similarity, enabling it to find the closest match for a given movie in the dataset. 
It reads training and testing data from CSV files, where each movie entry includes features and a corresponding label. 
After training, the program classifies movies in the testing dataset and evaluates its performance by calculating the classification accuracy. 
This implementation uses a simple approach with \( K = 1 \), meaning it selects the single most similar movie as the basis for classification.

I challenged myself to try and get the code to give back the highest accuracy possible within 2 weeks, getting to the high of 73% when
starting with a 0% acurracy on correct movie pedictions.
